Recently I've been doing a lot of mentorship, particularly around career growth.  If you would like some mentorship, I'm happy to help however I can, please reach out through [codingcoach.io](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/?name=Nick%20Larsen) and I'll try my best to help you with what you're working on.  Many of the questions have had a consistent theme lately, which is how do you know that you're doing the right thing?

I have lots of thoughts on this but for me it comes down to a few primary things that I feel like are pretty cross cutting, and something that I feel like I only recently realized during grad school.  In May I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology OMSCS program with a masters in computer science with a concentration on machine learning.  That's all well and good, but why did that help?

I initially went to grad school because I was learning machine learning and other AI techniques in my spare time doing self study.  I ran into a lot of trouble as the problems got more difficult and kept running into walls that I could not seem to get past for the life of me.  It was extremely frustrating.

## Be around people who are learning stuff as well

- The people around me were either not interested in the problems I was working on or they didn't have the skills to help me
- I initially went to grad school because I wanted to be surrounded by people who were learning the same stuff as me
- I was not dissapointed, there were hundreds or even thousands of people I came in contact with that were willing to work with me
- Being around people with different skill sets than you is a good thing, or else the only one learning is the one who doesn't know the most

## Do hard stuff

- I often get asked if this project that someone wants to try is a going to help their resume and I can't answer that
- Do stuff that is interesting to you, even if you think it's not interesting to other people
- Don't just do the TODO app tutorials, do something with the thing
- It shows that you're not just implementing what you're told to, you're applying it to new areas
- Failure is always an option

## Feedback is critical

- Of all the classes I took, the one I disliked the most during the time, turned out to be the most valuable so far
- When you are deep in self study, it is very difficult to tell whether or not you truly understand something or not
- Find some people who are willing to tell you what you're doing well **and** what you need to work on
- A lot of people don't get this even in places where it matters, like your job, even though you pay is tied to your performance to some degree, it can be very difficult to get the feedback on what you can improve on
- Working without feedback is like stumbling around in the dark and hoping you don't break anything, feedback is a flashlight, it wont give you a full picture of everything that's going on, but it will help guide you
- Ask for feedback (reference to old blog post) all the time, and take it with a grain of salt and ignore any toxicity

## Learning how to study well

- Directed, personalized feedback will help guide you but sometimes you do have to continue on by yourself
- Find other sources of feedback, define success metrics
- Write down the nuggets you find no matter how small
- Write down the stuff you think you might not understand well enough as you go, because you'll forget it
- Tell the story about A* search and how freaking hard it is
