## Dear Nick

how do you go about setting long term goals for self-learning? I find it hard to estimate how long things will take me, and, in some cases, what I will even be learning a couple months down the road. I guess I feel like I've been fudging my way through vague goals, but perhaps I need to accept that they can be changing and flexible rather than a strict timeline or plan.

I think I've asked most of the big questions that have been on my mind recently. I'd be very interested to hear about what drew you to ML, and what you're most excited about for the future of the field. I was watching some NLP and ML videos this weekend and now I'm all excited, haha. I want to be respectful of your time though; these aren't pressing, but more just my curiosity and wanting to know more.

Thank you for your insight and advice as always; it's incredibly helpful.

Best,
Cameron
