Time to up the production value of the stream a bit!  Here's the quick list of things we came up with to improve upon and we'll spend the next few days grinding through as much as we can before it's time to get back to doing some AI and stuff.


- colors:
    - right brain: F2531B
    - left brain: 797A7B
    - background: 405156
- make a new background for all scenes for consistency
- add in some background noise
    - hopefully this only goes to stream, not to me
    - consider adaptive background that get louder when im quiet for an extended period
- UI
    - last follower
    - last subscriber
    - cover more of the screen
    - keep the chat overlay or not, if yes then make it much easier to read
- transitions for scene to scene (not entirely sure what i want here)
- scenes within scenes? (do some research)
- new scenes
    - interview scene with no code (just talking) 2 people
    - interview scene with no code (just talking) 3 people
    - Mentorship Monday, that's easier to modify
    - whiteboard
- chat
    - get a chat bot
- video
    - lighting
    - zooming
    - size
    - look at chat?
- new interactions
    - raids happen
    - subscriptions
    - etc
    - left brain, right brain theme
- flip the logo horizontally to make the brains seem more correct
    - update the website with the updated logo
- including some stream plugins
    - amazon prime
    - closed captioning

### What did we accomplish today?

Quite the day, and now that we're all done, things already look better.  The hidden bottom bar and the color scheme went a long way toward cleaning things up and the logo behind the video was a nice touch.

Tomorrow we definitely want to look into nested scenes and see if we can get a lot of the video stuff taken care of so we can spend most of Friday getting a customizable chat bot rolling.  Thanks to everyone who joined and I look forward to see you all tomorrow!
