Today was a lot of fun!  We recapped a lot of what I accomplished off-stream and then we got into a discussion about heuristics for the NPuzzle problem.  This went from linear conflict to pattern databases and took a deviation into admissibility of heuristics for a bit.

At the end we decided to switch gears and collect some data for scaling up the finding directions problem.  We didn't get too far but we did find a library to help make loading the data much easier.
