We managed to send images to slack, but we hit the struggle bus when it came to collecting images from slack.  The error messages are not helpful, my understanding of what's going on is lacking, my google-fu isn't finding anything, do we just give up?

This is an example of something I feel like happens all the time when you're learning on your own and it was a large part of the reason why I joined grad school and what I hope to get out of streaming, that is, learning with other people.  The amount of frustration I experience in this episode is unfortunately quite common and I hope this video and the next serve as an example of how we improve ourselves and how we might find better ways of learning new things.
