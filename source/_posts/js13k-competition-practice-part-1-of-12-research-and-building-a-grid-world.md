Just got back from vacation and it was amazing.  Feeling very re-energized and ready to start a new project.

I got started with programming like a lot of other people, wanting to make games to play.  I have built some toy games at various points throughout my life and decided that once I graduate from grad school I want to commit to making an actual game that I release to the world.  Before that I'd like to practice, and so I was reminded of a small competition called [js13k](https://js13kgames.com/).  

The point of js13k is to build a complete game based on a theme that runs in a browser, from scratch, in one month.  And the kicker, _all_ of the games assets must be no larger than 13 kb when zipped up.  There have been some astonishing works of art that have come from this competition; take some time and browse through the winners of previous years competitions.

I decided that I will enter this competition in 2019, which starts August 13th, 2019, and now is as great a time as any to practice.  I stream 3 days per week and for roughly 2 hours a day, so total I should be able to get around 24 hours into this game.

In this first episode, I break down how I prepare for competitions like these, decide some high level ideas about the game and get started implementing a simple grid world which is going to be the basis for the world that my game will take place in.
