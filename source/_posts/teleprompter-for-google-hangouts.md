The inspiration for this came from doing interviews but there are tons of uses for this.  Whenever you are reading from a script and trying to talk to someone face to face at the same time, there is a disconnect where you are unable to guage the other person's reaction to the things you say.  

The goal of this project is to give you a way to still look at the person who you are talking to.  Because you don't really want this to get in the way, we use the [SpeechRecognition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) tooling built into the browser to automatically track what we're saying and auto check off the items in our script.
