The inspiration for this week's stream is to share a passion of mine which is teaching people how to succeed at technical interviews.  In this stream we cover a lot of the key aspects which you'll be graded on during an interview as well and do a full technical interview with Pablo, a friend of mine from the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech.

After the interview we take some questions from chat and discuss them in depth to help you figure out what to focus on when preparing for your next interview.
