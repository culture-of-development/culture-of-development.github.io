Sleep on it.  Your brain does amazing things when you go to sleep that improve your ability to learn and solve problems; just give it the opportunity to do it's thing and over time you'll be a much happier person.  I was having significant troubles with this slack bot and a little sleep and a recharge got me over a big challenge by rethinking where the problem might lie.  By using someone else's slack integration library we are now at the point of being able to collect images from slack and do the modifications we want to them using another library.

Of course this is still software development, so eventually we run into another problem...  time to go back to sleep.
