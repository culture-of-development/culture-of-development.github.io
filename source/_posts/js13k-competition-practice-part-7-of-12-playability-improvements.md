Today we focused almost entirely on adding in the final playability features and improvements to make certain things more obvious.

These improvements include things like...

- not walking through walls
- making the dialog screen capture the user input
- showing allowed paths
- making the move counter respect only real actions
- ...and a few other quick ones!

A lot of progress was made in cleaning things up along the way.  This is a good one full of lots of short, impactful changes and we identified a few poor design choices from earlier on as well.  At the very end, we made a solid TODO list for the next before we ended.  There are 5 sessions remaining and we set up a plan on how to spend each day if we had any chance of finishing.
