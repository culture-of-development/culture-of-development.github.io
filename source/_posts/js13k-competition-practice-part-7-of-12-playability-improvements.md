Today we focused almost entirely on adding in the final playability features and improvements to make certain things more obvious.

These improvements include things like...

- not walking through walls
- collecting items from containers such as filing cabinets
- making the dialog screen capture the user input
- showing allowed paths
- making the move counter respect only real actions
- ...and a few other quick ones!

A lot of progress was made in cleaning things up along the way.  This is a good one full of lots of short, impactful changes and we identified a few poor design choices from earlier on as well.
