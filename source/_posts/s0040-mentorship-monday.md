Welcome to Mentorship Monday!  This is my new spot for answering **your** questions about what it's like to be a professional developer.  I'm happy to help you with whatever it is you are having trouble with, from technical to organizational, to personal, just tweet me a question and I'll be happy to add your question to the list for the next episode!  Reach me at [fody on twitter](https://twitter.com/fody).

This week's episode we went over what mentorship is and how to know what kinds of questions are best for mentorship compared to things you might ask on stackoverflow.com or just looking up on google.  Short and sweet, please drop me a line and I'll be happy to get to your questions as soon as possible!
