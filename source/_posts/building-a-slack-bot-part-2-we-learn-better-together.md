Todays goals were to get our slack bot to respond to messages of the right type, handle the `needz moar help` request and send actual images to slack in reply to the correct `needz moar {something}` request.

Today right at the beginning [@a1ph4g33k](https://twitter.com/a1ph4g33k) stopped by with a suggestion to make something better.  We fired up a VS Code live share and the next three hours were an amazing experience of watching two people learn from each other and accomplish something at the same time.  This was hands down my favorite day streaming to date and I'm extremely thankful there are people like him in this community.

If you would like to jump on a project, I'm open arms accepting pair programming partners indefinitely, just reach out to me at my [twitter](https://twitter.com/fody) page.
